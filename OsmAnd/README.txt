Settings screen shows mode buttons (car, bicycle, pedestrian) at the top.  These are always
 visible.  The actual settings are below.

It is important to know if a setting is affected by the transportation mode.  Modes that are 
affected will be shown with a transportation mode icon. This icon is simply a label letting
the user know it is dependent on mode.  It is not a button.

The current value of the setting should be shown in the setting line.  For example: Unit of meausre will show

    Unit of Measure
    change units of length: mi/ft
    
    Auto zoom map [mode icon]
    auto zoom map according to your speed. true
    
Settings show the value of the setting for the selected mode. Switching modes will update
settings to show the value in that mode.  In this way inspecting the values for all modes
is easy. Just press the mode buttons one after another.
 
Changing modes will not change the scroll position of the settings.
 
 We no longer need to group all mode dependent settings in to one screen.
